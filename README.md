# Chord Katas

Chord [Katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) is a hobby project of mine intended to
help learn two things: acoustic guitar and pure functional programming.

Demo available at [chord-katas.dvail.com](chord-katas.dvail.com)

The idea for this app comes from learning about basic guitar chords, and how chord progressions are formed. The app
allow you to build up a chord progression from the seven scale degrees, and then change the chords of the progression
by key.

The idea is that by choosing common progressions (I, V, vi, IV) with different keys, you can build a wide variety of chord switching
technique through daily practice, not limited to chord+key combos found in your favorite songs.

## Tools

The app is built in [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) with [Elm-ish](https://github.com/collegevine/purescript-elmish) 
architecture, using React under the hood and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

The demo site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
